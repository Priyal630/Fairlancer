## Demo Data
The application currently uses mock data for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would connect to a backend API for real data.

## Payment Integration
The current implementation includes a simplified Razorpay integration. For a production deployment, you should implement:
- Server-side order creation and verification
- Webhook integration for payment status updates
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Time tracking functionality
